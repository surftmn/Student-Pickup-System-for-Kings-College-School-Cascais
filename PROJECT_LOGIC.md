# Kings College School - Student Pickup Management System Logic

## 🎯 System Overview

This is a comprehensive web-based student pickup management system designed for Kings College School in Cascais. The system facilitates secure and efficient coordination between parents, security personnel, monitors, and administrators during student pickup operations.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Frontend**: Role-based HTML dashboards with real-time updates
- **Backend**: Supabase database with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Authentication**: Secure role-based access control
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status synchronization across all dashboards

### User Roles
1. **Parents** - Request student pickups
2. **Security** - Manage student calls and facilitate pickups  
3. **Monitors** - Oversee pickup operations and track student movement
4. **Admin** - System administration and analytics

## 🔄 System Mechanics & Workflow

### 1. Parent-Initiated Pickup Request

**Process:**
1. **Parent Login**: Parent logs into their dashboard using Supabase authentication
2. **Student Selection**: Parent sees only their authorized children
3. **Pickup Request**: Parent clicks "Request Pickup" for a specific child
4. **Database Record**: System creates a `pickup_calls` record with status `pending`
5. **Real-time Notification**: Request appears immediately on Monitor and Security dashboards

**Security Features:**
- Parents can only see and request pickups for their authorized children
- Row Level Security (RLS) prevents unauthorized data access
- All requests are logged with timestamps and parent identification

### 2. Security-Initiated Student Call

**Process:**
1. **Direct Call**: Security personnel can directly call any student from their dashboard
2. **Student Availability**: Called student's status changes to `available` for pickup
3. **Real-time Updates**: Student appears in "Available for Pickup" sections across all dashboards
4. **Checkout Process**: Student remains available until marked as "checked out"

**Key Rules:**
- ✅ **Security** CAN call students directly
- ❌ **Monitors** CANNOT call students (view-only for calls)
- ❌ **Admin** CANNOT call students (analytics-focused role)

### 3. Monitor Operations

**Capabilities:**
- **View All Calls**: Monitors can see all pickup requests from parents and security calls
- **Status Updates**: Can mark students as "on the way" to pickup location
- **Process Management**: Approve/manage pickup requests from parents
- **Real-time Oversight**: Monitor overall pickup operations

**Restrictions:**
- ❌ Cannot directly call students
- ✅ Can visualize and manage existing calls
- ✅ Can update student status during pickup process

### 4. Parent Call Integration

**Unique Feature:**
- **Dual Notification**: When parents request pickup, the call appears on BOTH:
  - Security dashboard (for processing)
  - Monitor dashboard (for oversight)
- **Workflow Integration**: Parent requests flow through the same system as security calls
- **Unified Status**: All stakeholders see the same real-time status

## 📊 Status Flow & State Management

### Student Status States
```
1. WAITING → Student is in school, awaiting pickup request
2. CALLED → Security has called the student OR parent has requested pickup
3. ON_THE_WAY → Student is moving to pickup location (set by monitors)
4. AVAILABLE → Student is ready for pickup at security
5. CHECKED_OUT → Student has been picked up and left school
```

### Pickup Call Status Flow
```
1. PENDING → Initial request created (parent request or security call)
2. APPROVED → Monitor has approved the request
3. CALLED → Student has been notified/called
4. COMPLETED → Student has been successfully picked up
5. CANCELLED → Request was cancelled for any reason
```

## 🔐 Security & Access Control

### Role-Based Permissions

| Action | Parent | Security | Monitor | Admin |
|--------|--------|----------|---------|-------|
| Call Students | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Request Pickup | ✅ (own children) | N/A | ❌ | ❌ |
| View All Students | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Mark "On the Way" | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Complete Pickup | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View Statistics | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Manage Users | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### Data Security
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access controls
- **Authentication Required**: All actions require valid login
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all pickup activities
- **Parent Isolation**: Parents can only access their own children's data

## 🔄 Real-time Communication Flow

### Cross-Dashboard Updates
1. **Parent requests pickup** → Appears on Security & Monitor dashboards
2. **Security calls student** → Updates all dashboards instantly  
3. **Monitor marks "on the way"** → Status visible to all stakeholders
4. **Security completes pickup** → Final status update across system

### Notification Chain
```
Parent Dashboard → Database → Monitor Dashboard
                      ↓
              Security Dashboard
                      ↓
