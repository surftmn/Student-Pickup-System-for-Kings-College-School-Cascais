# 🚀 Complete Implementation Guide: AI-Powered Pickup Email System

## Overview
This guide will help you implement an automated system that:
- ✅ Monitors Gmail for **ALL pickup emails** from parents (normal and special pickups)
- ✅ Uses Google Gemini AI to extract student info, pickup times, and reasons **from every email**
- ✅ **Captures everything**: "I am picking my son Alan at 15:30h" appears in admin dashboard
- ✅ Identifies non-parent pickups and verifies ID documents (gets higher priority)
- ✅ Updates your admin dashboard with **all pickup notifications**
- ✅ Handles photo attachments (identity cards)

## 🎯 Phase 1: Database Setup (Start Here)

### Step 1.1: Create Database Tables
1. **Open your Supabase dashboard**
2. **Go to SQL Editor**
3. **Run this FIXED SQL code:** (Copy from `enhanced-pickup-schema.sql`)

**✅ This is the corrected version that fixes the "pickup_notifications_complete is not a table" error**

### Step 1.2: Verify Tables Created
Check that these tables exist in your database:
- ✅ `pickup_email_notifications`
- ✅ `pickup_documents`
- ✅ `pickup_notifications_complete` (view)

**Important**: If you still get errors, run the SQL in smaller chunks - first create the tables, then the view.

## 🎯 Phase 2: n8n Setup

### Step 2.1: Create n8n Account
1. **Go to:** [n8n.cloud](https://n8n.cloud)
2. **Sign up** with your email
3. **Choose Free Plan** (5,000 executions/month)
4. **Login to n8n dashboard**

### Step 2.2: Import CORRECTED Workflow
1. **In n8n, click "New Workflow"**
2. **Click the "..." menu**
3. **Choose "Import from JSON"**
4. **Copy and paste** the content from `n8n_gemini_pickup_workflow.json`
5. **Click "Import"**

**✅ The workflow now includes your Gemini API key (configured in N8N credentials)**

**✅ The nodes should now be properly connected after import**

### Step 2.3: Connect Your Accounts

#### Connect Gmail:
1. **Click on "Gmail Trigger" node**
2. **Click "Connect my account"**
3. **Login with your school Gmail account**
4. **Grant permissions**

#### Google Gemini:
**✅ Configure with your Gemini API key in N8N credentials! No additional setup needed.**

#### Connect Supabase:
1. **Get your Supabase URL and API key**
2. **In n8n, click any "Supabase" node**
3. **Click "Connect my account"**
4. **Enter your credentials:**
   - URL: `https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co`
   - API Key: `YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## 🎯 Phase 3: Understanding What Gets Captured

### ✅ ALL Pickup Situations Are Captured:

**Normal Parent Pickup:**
```
"I am picking my son Alan at 15:30h"
```
**Result:** Shows in dashboard as "Alan will leave at 15:30 with parent/guardian: [Parent Name]. Reason: No reason provided"

**Doctor Appointment:**
```
"Adrian needs to leave at 13:45 for doctor appointment. I'll pick him up."
```
**Result:** Shows as "Adrian will leave at 13:45 with parent/guardian: [Parent Name]. Reason: Doctor appointment"

**Non-Parent Pickup (Gets High Priority):**
```
"Francisco will pick up Adrian at 13:45 for doctor appointment"
```
**Result:** Shows as "Adrian will leave at 13:45 with: Francisco ⚠️ NON-PARENT PICKUP - ID VERIFICATION REQUIRED. Reason: Doctor appointment"

2. **Add these lines to the `<head>` section:**
```html
<link href="css/enhanced-pickup-notifications.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

3. **Add this line before closing `</body>`:**
```html
<script src="js/enhanced-pickup-notifications.js"></script>
```

## 🎯 Phase 5: Testing

### Step 5.1: Test with Sample Emails

**Test 1: Normal Parent Pickup**
```
Subject: Alan pickup today

Hi,
I am picking my son Alan at 15:30h.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

**Test 2: Non-Parent Pickup**
```
Subject: Early pickup for Adrian

Hi,
Adrian needs to leave school today at 1:45 PM. 
Francisco will be picking him up for a doctor appointment.
I'm attaching his uncle's ID for verification.

Thanks,
Maria (Adrian's mom)
```

### Step 5.2: Check n8n Execution
1. **Go to n8n**
2. **Click "Executions" tab**
3. **You should see your workflow running**
4. **Check each node to see the data flow**

### Step 5.3: Check Database
1. **Go to Supabase**
2. **Check `pickup_email_notifications` table**
3. **You should see records for BOTH test emails**

### Step 5.4: Check Admin Dashboard
1. **Open your admin dashboard**
2. **Look for the "AI-Powered Pickup Email Notifications" section**
3. **You should see both notifications** - one marked as normal priority, one as high priority

## 🎯 Phase 6: Fine-tuning

### Step 6.1: Adjust AI Prompts
If the AI isn't extracting information correctly:

1. **In n8n, click "Gemini - Extract Pickup Info" node**
2. **Modify the prompt** to be more specific for your email patterns
3. **Test with different email formats**

### Step 6.2: Add More Keywords
Update the Gmail filter in n8n:
1. **Click "Gmail Trigger" node**
2. **Update query** to include Portuguese/Spanish terms if needed:
```
subject:(early pickup OR leaving early OR pick up OR pickup OR saída OR recolher) OR body:(...)
```

## 🎯 Phase 7: Production Setup

### Step 7.1: Update Remaining Credentials
Replace these placeholder values in n8n:
- ✅ `your-gemini-credential-id` → **Configure with your Gemini API key**
- ✅ `your-supabase-credential-id` → Your actual Supabase credentials
- ✅ `your-gmail-credential-id` → Your actual Gmail credentials

### Step 7.2: Activate Workflow
1. **In n8n, toggle workflow to "Active"**
2. **Save the workflow**

### Step 7.3: Set Up Supabase Storage
1. **In Supabase, go to Storage**
2. **Create bucket:** `pickup-documents`
3. **Make it public** (for viewing images)
